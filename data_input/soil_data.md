# Soil Data Used in This Study  
**Dataset DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17603216

This repository provides the link to the soil (edaphic) data used in our modelling study.

We sourced edaphic attributes from **SoilGrids v2.0**, which provides global estimates of soil properties generated by machine-learning algorithms trained on more than 240,000 soil profiles and multiple environmental covariates. SoilGrids has established itself as a principal global source of soil data, widely used in agricultural zoning, climate-change assessments and species distribution modelling, and is considered reliable for large-scale analyses.

We selected the **15–30 cm depth interval** as a critical portion of the active root zone in citrus and other perennial fruit trees, where a substantial share of fine absorbing roots occurs. From this layer, we compiled key soil variables commonly used in agricultural suitability assessments, including:

- **Texture attributes:** clay, sand, silt    
- **Soil pH (H₂O)**   
- **Organic carbon content (OC)**  
- **Available water capacity (AWC)**  
- Other variables relevant to edaphic suitability (see Table 1 in the manuscript)
