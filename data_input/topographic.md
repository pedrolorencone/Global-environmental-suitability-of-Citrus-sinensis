This repository provides the link to the topographic data used in our modelling study.

The elevation layer was obtained from **WorldClim v2.1** at **2.5 arc-minute (~5 km)** resolution, matching the spatial resolution of the climatic and edaphic layers used in the analysis. From this elevation layer, **slope (degrees)** was derived in a GIS environment using a standard terrain analysis tool that estimates the maximum gradient between each elevation cell and its adjacent neighbors.
