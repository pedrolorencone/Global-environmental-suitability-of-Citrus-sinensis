# Climate Data Used in This Study  
**Dataset DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17602765

This repository provides the link to the climate data used in our modelling study.  
We compiled **19 bioclimatic variables (BIO1–BIO19)** from **WorldClim v2.1** at  
**2.5 arc-minute (~5 km)** spatial resolution.

For future conditions, the same variables were obtained from five **CMIP6 global  
climate models** (ACCESS-CM2, BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, MIROC6 and MRI-ESM2-0),  
covering four time periods (2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080 and 2081–2100) and  
four SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5).

All future projections were harmonised into a **multi-model ensemble mean**,  
a recommended approach to reduce model-specific biases and improve climate  
robustness for species distribution modelling.
